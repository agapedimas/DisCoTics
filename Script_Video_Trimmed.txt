Scene 1: Nathan
- It’s Christmas time! 
- and what better way to celebrate than giving each of our friends and families a Christmas Hamper!
- You head out to the nearest convenient store but they are low on stock. 
- So you bought just about any random mix of snacks and drinks haht you can get.
- You want every hamper to have a variety of flavors, 
- but how do you avoid a "chocolate overload" while keeping the price and item counts identical?

Scene 2: Vian
- So here is the goal, we want each hamper to:
1. Contain the same number of food and drink according to the determined amount.
2. Contain items of different flavors so a chocolate pudding cannot be put alongside chocolate milk (No chocolate overload).
3. Each hamper's value must be within the determined budget. 

- Lucky for you, there is a mathmatical solution to that using the Graph Coloring Theory.

Scene 3: Dimas
- Graph Coloring is the process of assigning labels/colors to the vertices of a graph.
- The general rule of thumb is that no two vertices that are connected by an edge can have the same color.
- The most popular graph coloring algorithm is Welsh-Powell's algorithm:
- Here you can pause the video to read the full algorithm.
- In our case, each item is a vertex, and shared flavors are the edges connecting them.
- Ther result: After assigning all colors, you will have a graph of conflicting flavors for every item.
- Each color contains every item that can coexist within one hamper.

Scene 4: Pearce
- Here is a web we made called the Christmas Hamper Factory. 
- Demo: 
- All you need to do is add the items with the tambah button, 
1 Type the name of the snack
2. The price
3. The quantitiy you have
4. Select the flavor
5. Choose whether it is a beverage or a snack.
- Add all the item you have then, determine:
1. The number of hamper you wnat to make.
2. The budget for each hamper.
3. And the minimum number of snack/beverage each hamper must contain.

- After all items and parameters are set, 
- click on the "Buat Kombinasi Bingkisan" button to create all the possible combinations of hamper with those requirements.
- You can see the output below it and what each hamper/color contains with the total price required for it. 
- You can check the list for all the hampers created with each contents according to the number of items you have.
- We also include a randomize items list to test the program or to have fun with it.
